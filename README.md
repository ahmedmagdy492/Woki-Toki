# Woki-Toki

is basically a c application that emulates the real world woki-toki but instead of sending data through radio waves it uses the normal internet that we use on the daily basis.

# Main Components
- UI made using raylib
- Audio Handling using SDL2
- Networking using barkely sockets
- Threading using pthread
